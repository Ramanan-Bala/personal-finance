# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation Report

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` package using npm
- Package version installed: Latest available on npm registry
- Updated `package.json` with the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` to reflect the new dependency tree

### 2. Root Layout Modification
**File Modified:** `src/app/layout.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the Theme wrapper
- Placement ensures analytics tracking is initialized after all other providers and components

**Implementation Details:**
The Analytics component was placed after the main content and all providers to ensure:
- All React context providers are properly initialized first
- The component doesn't interfere with existing layout structure
- Analytics tracking begins after the app is fully rendered
- Follows Vercel's recommended placement for App Router projects
