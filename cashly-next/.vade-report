Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` package using npm
- Updated package.json and package-lock.json with the new dependency

### 2. Updated Root Layout (src/app/layout.tsx)
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after all other components
- Maintained existing code structure and preserved all existing components and providers

## Implementation Details

This is an **App Router** project (using the `app` directory), so the Analytics component was added to:
- **File**: `src/app/layout.tsx`
- **Location**: Inside the `<body>` tag, after the Theme provider and all child components
- **Import**: `@vercel/analytics/next` (the Next.js-specific export)

The Analytics component is now properly positioned to track page views and web vitals across the entire application.

## Verification Steps Completed

✅ Build verification: `npm run build` completed successfully
✅ Linter check: No linting errors introduced in layout.tsx
✅ All changes staged with git (package.json, package-lock.json, src/app/layout.tsx)

## Notes

- The project uses npm as its package manager (detected from package-lock.json)
- The Analytics component will automatically begin collecting anonymous usage data when deployed to Vercel
- No additional configuration is required; Vercel will automatically enable analytics for the deployment
- The existing code structure, including all providers (ThemeProvider, AuthProvider, FontProvider) and components (Toaster, ServiceWorkerRegister), has been preserved
